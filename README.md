# Cognizant-Internship-Tasks
During my internship at Cognizant, I undertook a data analysis project focused on traffic management and investigating instances of malpractice related to people not applying for EZPass in Elizabeth Canal California. The Elizabeth Canal, being a significant transportation route, relied on the EZPass system for efficient toll collection and traffic management. However, there were concerns about a considerable number of users who seemed to be avoiding or neglecting the EZPass system, leading to potential revenue loss and traffic disruptions.

My primary objective during the internship was to analyze the available data to gain insights into the extent of this malpractice and identify patterns or factors contributing to non-compliance with the EZPass system.

To begin the analysis, I worked with a vast dataset containing toll transaction records, vehicle information, and user demographics. The data spanned a substantial period, providing a comprehensive view of the toll collection process and user behaviors.

The first step involved data cleaning and preprocessing, where I dealt with missing values, standardized data formats, and removed any outliers that might have skewed the analysis.

Next, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain an initial understanding of the data distribution and uncover any trends or correlations. EDA allowed me to visualize toll collection patterns, peak traffic times, and demographic distributions of EZPass users versus non-users.

To identify potential malpractice instances, I conducted statistical analyses to compare the toll payment patterns between EZPass users and non-users. This helped in determining whether certain vehicles or demographics were consistently avoiding the EZPass system.

Additionally, I employed data visualization techniques to create insightful graphs and charts to present my findings in a clear and understandable manner. Visualizations played a crucial role in highlighting the differences in toll payment behaviors, making it easier to convey the importance of addressing the malpractice.

Throughout the internship, I collaborated with a team of experts, including transportation engineers and data analysts, to discuss and validate my findings. Their feedback and insights contributed significantly to the overall analysis.

By the end of the internship, I had gained valuable experience in data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization techniques, specifically within the context of transportation systems. My work provided the Elizabeth Canal with valuable insights and actionable recommendations to curb malpractice, optimize toll collection, and improve overall traffic management through enhanced EZPass adoption. The internship not only allowed me to apply my data analysis skills but also deepened my understanding of transportation systems and their interplay with data-driven decision-making.
